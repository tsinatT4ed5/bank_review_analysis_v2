This repository contains the code and data for Task 1, which involved scraping customer reviews for CBE, BOA, and Dashen banks from the Google Play Store. Using the google-play-scraper and pandas, we collected 1,362 raw reviews and then cleaned the data by removing duplicates and normalizing dates.  The final clean dataset, available in data/clean_bank_reviews.csv, contains 1,187 unique reviews. This result is 13 reviews short of the 1,200+ target due to the necessary removal of duplicates, but the data is clean and ready for the next phase of analysis. The repository is fully set up with a task-1 branch, descriptive commits, and all necessary scripts (scrape_reviews.py, preprocess_data.py) and files (requirements.txt, .gitignore).
